# Initialize Public Repository

Make sure your public repository is properly initialized with at least one file:

1. Go to https://github.com/KodeMinds-Global/opulent-travels-public
2. If it's completely empty, click "Add file" → "Create new file"
3. Name the file: README.md
4. Add this content:
   ```
   # Opulent Travels

   This repository contains the public website for Opulent Travels.
   ```
5. Click "Commit new file"

6. Create a .nojekyll file:
   - Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
   - Name the file: .nojekyll
   - Leave the content empty
   - Click "Commit new file"

These steps ensure the repository is properly initialized and ready to receive the deployed files.
